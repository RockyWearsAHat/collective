    <!-- ONLY NEEDED FOR DEVELOPMENT, REMOVE BEFORE BUILD OR CAN CAUSE ERRORS, I WANT TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS PROGRAMATICALLY
    BUT I CANNOT FIGURE IT OUT HOW, I CAN'T REWRITE THE INDEX.HTML FILE IF IT'S IN PROD BECAUSE IT'S BUNDLED INTO A SEPERATE PLACE,
    COULD POSSIBLY JUST REMOVE THE WHOLE SCRIPT LINK TAG IF THE SERVER IS BEING RUN IN PRODUCTION, BUT TO DYNAMICALLY ADD/REMOVE THIS
    CODE IS FUCKING TERRIBLE AS IT JUST KEEPS THROWING ERRORS :( -->
