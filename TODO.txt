Set up onboarding to allow people to enter their banking information for transfers

Refine the register page to allow people to sign up as customers or as artists

I don't know if I need to store a customer id, but if so I can use the customers API

DON'T ALLOW UPLOADING OF PRODUCTS BEFORE THE USER HAS TRANSFERS SETUP

Once onboarding is done and transfers are enabled, stripe webhook can take an account id and transfer a percentage 
of a product's price to it
