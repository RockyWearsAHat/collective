Issue with adding/removing items from cart, when removing items, sometimes a previous version of the document is attempted to be modified,
thus a version error is thrown like: 

VersionError: No matching document found for id "664269fa89b3ce1870599c6b" version 48 modifiedPaths "cart"

the versioning is already on __v49, and this causes a server crash, why is it attempting to modify an old version of the document?
And why does it only happen when multiple items are in the cart?

The document still gets added to mongo and updated with a new versioning number, the server for some reason tries to access the old
version of the document?

This is strange
